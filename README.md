# Design-of-Chamber-Environmental-Detection-Device
Design of Chamber Environmental Detection Device with C Codeï¼ŒThis device can get the concentration of PM2.5 and formaldehyde, the temperature and relative humidity of air also could be measured. Detection device is based on STC12C5A16S2, The sensors is used to get the concentration of formaldehyde and PM2.5, the temperature and relative humidity of the chamber air. If the concentration of formaldehyde levels is too high, buzzer alarm will work. This paper is successful accomplish the design of software and hardware. The result is perfect.
